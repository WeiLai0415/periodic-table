## History of Periodic Table

Through the number of experiments and observations, scientists were able to group [elements](https://chemistrygod.com/the-most-abundant-elements) by developing periodic law and periodic table in a systematic approach.

**Johann Dobereiner**, the German chemist in the early 1800s was the first person to saw the trend and pattern in properties of elements. In 1829 he noted the similarity among the physical and chemical properties of elements, he grouped the elements in three called a triad.

**In this triads** he observed that mean of atomic weights first and last elements were equal to the atomic weight of the middle element. He also observed that the properties of the middle element were similar to the properties of the first and last element.

Dobereiner’s periodic law also referred to as the **law of triad** was only applicable to few elements, when new elements have discovered the law of triad failed to justify the periodicity of elements.

Another attempt of building the periodic table made by **A.E.B. de Chancourtois** a French geologist in 1862. He arranged element in increasing order of the atomic weights and created a cylindrical table in which elements with similar properties were close to each other, but he failed because it was not an efficient solution.

After that in 1865 the English chemist, **John Alexander Newlands** profounded the **Law of Octave**. He made a periodic table by placing elements in increasing order of their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element in the table has similar chemical and physical properties to the first element.
